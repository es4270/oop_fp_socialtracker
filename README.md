# oop_fp_socialtracker
obj oriented programming final project tracker

Hello, I tried making a socialtracker. The premise is that you can add friends, add cadences to how often you want to see them, receive reminders to make hangout appointments, schedule hangouts, have hangouts, and score the hangouts, then see the results of those hangouts on leaderboards that are sorted.

This involved 1000 lines of code and honestly it is not very good. I am greatly struggling and feel quite out of my depth here. I hope you can recognize that I tried my best and put in a lot of work.

Just by running the main, everything should start, and you should be able to navigate from page to page.
